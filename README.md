# Navbar

This is a sample of NavBar in HTML / CSS / JavaScript using a very simple style. You will find 4 different files:

- index.html: This file contains the main structure of the navbar.
- style.css: This file contains the design of the navbar, its structure and how it is organized.
- script.js: Finally, this file is about the functionality of the navbar, hamburger icon, animations, etc.
- logo.png: The logo used for this navbar. It comes from an old project for my studies.

 You can freely download this little project and explore it by your own without any problems! Enjoy it!
